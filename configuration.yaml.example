# Example Home Assistant configuration
# This file shows how to set up helper entities if needed
# (The card works with existing entities, but you may want to create input_number helpers for timer duration)

input_number:
  # Optional: Create input numbers for timer durations if you want to adjust them via UI
  bedroom_light_timer:
    name: Bedroom Light Timer Duration
    initial: 600
    min: 60
    max: 3600
    step: 60
    unit_of_measurement: seconds

# Optional: Automation example for motion sensor (though the card handles this)
# automation:
#   - alias: "Bedroom Light Motion"
#     trigger:
#       - platform: state
#         entity_id: binary_sensor.bedroom_motion
#         to: 'on'
#     action:
#       - service: light.turn_on
#         entity_id: light.bedroom_light
